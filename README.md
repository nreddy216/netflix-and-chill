###Welcome to NetFlix and "Chill" üé•! Where you literally just watch netflix and "chill" üòè or not üòù. That is entirely up to you and your future partner(s) üòâ! This App will match you with someone(s) so that you can watch a show/movie with them real life or online.
#WELL,

##Planning Phase
###We have mostly used [Trello](https://trello.com/b/IG8cM9yL/netflix-chill) with animal member pictures üê®üê∂üê± to plan our user stories due to Brian's OCD-ness. He will die if the board is not organized. Jessie wrote a bunch of Granular and "friendly" user stories and Nidhi drew the fancy wireframes by using Balsamiq.
